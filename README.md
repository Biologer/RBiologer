RBiologer is, as you probably know, an official R package for Biologer. It is used to download data from multiple Biologer servers using your user token. It also contains various functions that we use for simple statistical analysis and data overview.

To get started, use biologer.login() to logg into the biologer server(s). After successfull login, you will be able to download and update data using get_biologer_data().
