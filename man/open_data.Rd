\title{Load and Consolidate Biologer Data}
\usage{
open_data(auto.download = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{auto.download}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), the function first calls
\code{\link{get_biologer_data}()} to download the latest data from all configured
Biologer servers before consolidation. If \code{FALSE}, it only loads existing
files from the storage path.}
}
\value{
A single \code{data.table} containing all consolidated and merged observation
records. This \code{data.table} includes columns from both Field and Literature
observations, with non-matching columns filled with \code{NA}.
}
\description{
This function reads, joins, and consolidates observation (Field and
Literature) and taxonomic data downloaded from one or more Biologer servers. It
performs server-specific joins with taxonomy data and then merges all resulting
observations into a single, comprehensive \code{data.table}.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item For each active Biologer server, it reads three files: Taxonomy (\code{biologer_taxa}),
Field Observations (\code{biologer_field_observations}), and Literature Observations
(\code{biologer_literature_observations}).
\item It performs a left join (1:N) between the Observation dataframes and the Taxonomy
dataframe using \code{taxon.id} (Observation) and \code{id} (Taxonomy).
\item It uses \code{data.table::fread} for fast file reading and \code{data.table::rbindlist}
with \code{fill = TRUE} for fast and safe row-wise consolidation across different servers and
between the Field and Literature datasets.
}
